# My Personal Website Written in Nuxt

Why did I create this using Nuxt? Isn't that overkill for such a basic website? Yes it is. It should just be a single simple `html` file with vanilla `js` mixed in.

But my plan is to build this out in various frameworks as a way to learn the basics of each one. Next up is `rust/wasm` - I'm looking at you [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/).
